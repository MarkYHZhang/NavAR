# NavAR
NavAR is a new and easier way of exploring the physical world using modern technology. Not only does it offer the ability for the users to set personal waypoints such as buildings on a campus, but it also provide tourism information for attractions.

## Features
1. Add/Delete custom waypoints
2. Display waypoints using augenmented reality technology (Google's ARCore)
3. Making use of GPS data to calculate precise distance
